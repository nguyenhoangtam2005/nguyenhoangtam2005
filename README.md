### Hi, I'm Hoang Tam 👋

UX/UI Designer and Frontend Developer (basic) currently working on real-world products.  
Focused on building interfaces that are clear, usable, and logically structured.

Strong interest in **UX/UI thinking**, **frontend fundamentals**, and how systems are designed from both user and technical perspectives.  
I care about details, consistency, and long-term maintainability rather than quick hacks.
