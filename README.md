Driven by UX logic, system thinking, and real user behavior rather than visual trends alone.  
Always questioning *why* a feature exists, *how* users actually interact with it, and *what* can be simplified or improved.

Comfortable working across the full flow — from understanding user problems, structuring information, designing interfaces, to translating designs into clean, maintainable frontend code.  
Believer in clarity over complexity, usability over decoration, and building products that actually get used.

Continuously improving both design thinking and frontend skills to become a stronger product-focused UX/UI designer who understands how things are truly built.
