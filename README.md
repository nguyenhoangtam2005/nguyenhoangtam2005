Focused on designing clear, usable, and scalable interfaces grounded in UX logic, system thinking, and real user behavior — not visual trends alone.
Constantly questioning why a feature exists, how users interact with it, and what can be simplified or improved.

Experienced across the core UX/UI workflow — from problem discovery and information architecture to interface design and usability refinement.

Frontend fundamentals (HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript) are used as a supporting skill to communicate effectively with developers and ensure designs are realistic and buildable.

Value clarity over complexity, usability over decoration, and product outcomes over visual polish.
Continuously deepening UX/UI expertise while maintaining and strengthening frontend basics to design better, more practical products.
